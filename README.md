This repository was forked from BubbaVV/Pyevolve, which updates Perone/Pyevolve (the original authors) to work with Python 3.
This repository fixes a few small issues to enable it to run in Python 3.13.  It also adds a pyproject.toml file to enable
using `uv` to build and manage the project.

Tests are now run using `pytest`

The documentation (html rendered) is still hosted at sourceforge.net at http://pyevolve.sourceforge.net/0_6rc1/
